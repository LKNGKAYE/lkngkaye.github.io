    <p class="my-paragraph"> <strong class=
    "my-strong">Fantastic Mr. Fox is on the
    run! </strong> The three meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat
    Boggis, squat Bunce, and skinny Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox and
    his family surrounded. What they don't know is that they're not dealing with just
    any fox â€“ Mr. Fox would never surrender. But only the most fantastic plan ever
    can save him now.</p>
